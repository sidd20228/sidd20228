# 👋 Hi, I’m Siddhant Parashar

🎓 B.Tech @ Delhi Technological University (DTU)  
🤖 AI, ML, Backend Systems, Security Engineering  
🏆 Smart India Hackathon Finalist | CTF Winner 

I build production-grade systems that prioritize performance, security, and maintainability. Also known to enjoy debugging things most people prefer to avoid.

## 🧩 About Me

I’m a systems-oriented developer who enjoys working where theory meets production. That usually means scalable backends, security-critical infrastructure, and AI systems that actually ship.

What I spend my time on:
- 🔐 Researching AI-driven Web Application Firewalls for zero-day exploit detection  
- ⚙️ Designing low-latency backend systems that stay stable under load  
- 🧠 Applying ML and DL to real engineering problems, not just notebooks  
- 🧪 Solving CTFs, reviewing architecture, and fixing bugs that surface at inconvenient hours  

I care deeply about code quality, clean abstractions, and building things that other developers can comfortably work with.
